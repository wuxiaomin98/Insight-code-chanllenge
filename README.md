Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

For this coding challenge, you will develop tools that could help analyze the community of Twitter users.  For simplicity, the features we will build are primitive, but you could easily build more complicated features on top of these.   

## Requirements
For feature 2, package networkx is needed, install it with:

sudo pip install networkx

## Run program
Try with ./run.sh in the root directory

If you want to try only one of the code, use:

python ./src/tweets_cleaned.py ./tweet_input/tweets.txt ./tweet_output/ft1.txt

or
python ./src/average_degree.py ./tweet_input/tweets.txt ./tweet_output/ft2.txt
